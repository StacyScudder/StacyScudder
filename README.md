- 👋 Hi, I’m @StacyScudder
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as possible! Learning is my addiction.
- 🌦️ My newest project is looking at historical weather data for Portugal to find the best area to move to. 
- 💞️ I'm focused on my project to create a Spotify playlist based on the description of any book I'm reading.

### Naming rules for repositories:
A repository that starts with MW will be my work<br>
A repository that starts with P is practice. These are usually tutorials from books or websites that I've used to learn something new.<br>
Inside the bootcamp repository is all the work I did while in bootcamp. Some of these were done in a group (G) and some are individual (I) 

<!---
StacyScudder/StacyScudder is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
